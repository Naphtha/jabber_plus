# Jabber+ #

A rip-off of Google+ only in name. This repository stores some custom emoticons for the Cisco Jabber chat client. Anyone should feel free to contribute! Makes Jabber a little more fun. :beers:

## Installing ##

On Windows the recomended way to install custom emoticons is to navigate to the folder at %appdata%\Roaming\Cisco\Unified Communication\Jabber\CSF\CustomEmoticons and replace its contents with the files in this repository.

On other platforms, find the Jabber installation directory and look for the CustomEmoticons directory.

After replacing the contents of the CustomEmoticons directory restart Jabber.

The emoticons should now appear in the emoticon menu inside chat windows.

## Contributing ##

* Fork this repository. (optional)

* Clone/Download this repo.

* Add the desired emoticon as a PNG and edit the emoticonDefs.xml file appropriately.

* Submit a pull request.

## Tips ##

Try to keep all PNGs named in a sane manner, and do not use capitals. Windows doesn't always discriminate between capital letters in filenames so this could cause problems for supporting multiple platforms.

Keep PNGs to a reasonable size, otherwise using that emoticon will simply stretch beyond the default chat window size. Most emoticons won't need to be larger than 100px by 100px.
